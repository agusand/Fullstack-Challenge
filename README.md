-   I decided to use Context API for state managment because is simple and enough in this case.
-   Talking about the style, i have applied Material UI to ensure efficiency and accessibility.
-   I have written some tests for my utils tools. I created a workflow on GitHub actions to run them in every pull request.
-   I chose Vercel as hosting because of its good service and speed for Create React App applications, even being free.
-   I have developed the app and its backend with Typescript because it helps to make a more robust codebase, and avoid errors.
